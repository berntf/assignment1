This whole preference profile is build around the fact I don't drink alcohol. So it's very important to me that there are non-alcoholic drinks available at the party. The only options for Drinks for which there will be non-alcoholic beverages available at the pary are Non-Alcoholic and Catering. I prefer Catering, as this means that there will also be alcoholic drinks available for those that do want to drink alcohol. All the other issues don't matter to me that much, although Food is a little more important than the rest of the issues and music is a non-issue for me. That's why Drinks got a weight of 0.8 and the rest of the weight is spread around the other issues. This means that a negotiator should try to get the non-alcoholic drinks options chosen and concede on all the other issues. Because the party isn't important enough for me to go to when there isn't anything to drink, I've put the reservation value at 0.5. So any negotiator should only accept (and offer) bids which contain Non-Alcoholic or Catering for Drinks.
